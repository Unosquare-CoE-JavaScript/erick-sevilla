# Go
## WhatÂ´s GO
Go is a languaje created by google focused the simplicity and performance of the execution of the programs, also one of the main key pros of the languaje is the garbage colector and variables memory life cycle, go handles the creation and also the destruction of the instances, it takes care of not leaving any variables unused.

## Primitive Types and Variables  

In GO a variable is diclared with the key word var followed by the name of the variable and then the type
### types
The main types of varibles are:
- Int32
- Int64
- Float64
- Float128
- String
- Boolean

### Variable declarations
So one variable declaration will look like:
```
    //"var" key word + name of the variable + variable type + value 
    var i int = 10
```

an important thing to mention about the variable declarations is that go will imply the type and also the valie if those are not defined initiating the variable with the default values and types, for example
```
    var i = 10
    
```
In this example we can see that the variable type is not defined so go will take the value assigned to it and will automaticly imply that it is an Integer
```
    var s = "This is just a string"
```
in this other example, go is implying that the var type will be an String
This will also happend with the value definition, if we instasiate a variable defining the variable type but not a value go takes care of it and assigns it a default value as in the example 

```
    var i int
    fmt.PrintLn(i)
    //Outcome: 0 
```
### Declaration scope
Go implements a easy way to declare a private or public variable, for variables that have to be only accesible on the same package it should be named woth the cammel case convention (low case first letter) and if the variable could be access from another packages it should be named with the Pascal nameing convention (Upper case 3forst letter)

### Parsiong
Talking about variable types we can convert diferent type of varibles to a diferent one, for example we can get an integer and convert it to a float or and string and viceverse as in the following example 
```
    var i int = 10
    var f float32 = float32(i)
```

## Arrays
the arrays, as the variables must be defined as following 

```
    var array [3]int = [3]int{10, 20, 30}
    fmt.Println(array)
    //Outcome: [10, 20, 30]
```
Once declared we have multiple ways to use the information that exists into the array
we can add new values to the array 
```
    var array [3]int = [3]int{10, 20, 30}
    append(array, 40)
    fmt.Println(array)
    //Outcome: [10, 20, 30, 40]
```
We can access to a different range of positions of the array
```
    a := [10]int{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}
    b := a[:]
    c := a[2:]
    d := a[:5]
    e := a[2:7]

    fmt.Printf("A: %v\n", a)
    fmt.Printf("B: %v\n", b)
    fmt.Printf("C: %v\n", c)
    fmt.Printf("D: %v\n", d)
    fmt.Printf("E: %v\n", e)

    // Outcome:
    //  A: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
    //  B: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
    //  C: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
    //  D: [1,2,3,4,5]
    //  E: [3,4,5,6,7]

```
also we can declare multidimentional arrays also known as matrix

```
    var identityMatrix [3][3]int = [3][3]int {
        [3]int{1,0,0}
        [3]int{0,1,0}
        [3]int{0,0,1}
    }
    fmt.Println(identityMatrix)

    //Outcome:
    //{[1 0 0] [0 1 0] [0 0 1]}
```

## Maps
The way to work with object in Go is called maps, those structures help us to arrange informations using keys and values
The declaration of this structures are the following:
```
shoppingCart := make(map[string]int)
shoppingCart = map [string]int{
    "Keyboard": 100,
    "Mouse": 50,
    "Laptop":1000
}
```

WIth this kind of struture we can access to the information, use, edit or create new by using the key values of it as in the following examplle
```
    shoppingCart := make(map[string]int)
    shoppingCart = map [string]int{
        "Keyboard": 100,
        "Mouse": 50,
        "Laptop":1000
    }
    shoppingCart["Laptop"] = 1200
    delete(shoppingCart, "Mouse")
    fmt.Println(shoppingCart)
    //Outcome: 
    // map[Keyboard: 100 Laptop: 1200]
```
